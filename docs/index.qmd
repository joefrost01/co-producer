# Welcome to Co-Producer

**Co-Producer** is an AI-powered collaborative music production assistant designed to help musicians explore creative ideas, learn new techniques, and structure their production workflow. The system acts as a **smart collaborator**, allowing users to work alongside AI to shape their musical projects while gaining new skills.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Creative Collaboration**: Generate production ideas, refine arrangements, and experiment with different styles.
- **Learning Integration**: Get tailored learning resources for instruments, techniques, and production styles.
- **Track Development**: Follow structured workflows to build a song from initial concept to completion.
- **Equipment Awareness**: AI understands your available gear, plugins, and instruments to provide practical suggestions.
- **Flexible AI Integration**: Work with connected AI models (LangChain-Rust) or use an offline JSON-based briefing system.
